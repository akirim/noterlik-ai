Notary Publics document operations for assuring security and preventing disagreements and execute other duties given by laws. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> Foundation process of notary public’s offices and their competences</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> Article 2 – In every place where a court of first instance or an individual civil court of peace has been established, a notary public’s office is founded to be authorized to execute the notary public operations of this court according to its field of jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> (Additional second clause: 2/3/2005-5309/art. 1) However if the field of jurisdiction of the court of first instance covers more than one district, then notary public’s offices can be established in other districts.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> In so far, if there is more than one notary public office in municipality borders of one county, every notary public’s office is authorized to execute all notary public operations in the municipality borders of the county and this without being restricted by the field of jurisdiction of the court of first instance. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> (Additional fourth clause: 14/7/2004-5219/art. 8) The operations of the first, second and third class notary public’s offices situated in a district where the court of first instance has been erected continue. In these places, we can also establish more than one notary public’s office. The notary public’s offices whose operations continue in a district without a court of first instance or which is under the same field of jurisdiction recently reestablished but is not situated in the same municipality borders are not subject to the provisions of article 109.(1)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> The provisions of the chapter ten are reserved.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> Foundation process of more than one notary public’s office and closure of the notary public’s office</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> Article 3 – The Ministry of Justice can establish more than one notary public’s office in the places where arising business overload exists.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> The Ministry of Justice uses its authority written hereinabove by taking into account in one hand the total of the gross income of the notary public’s offices situated in one place and in the other hand the evolutions and developments in the business life.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> Upon condition that they are dismantled, it can close more than one of the actual notary public’s offices.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> The Ministry of Justice takes the opinion of the Notaries Union of Turkey before it uses its authority about establishing or closing more than one notary public’s office.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(Last additional clause: 14/7/2004-5219/art. 8). If the first, second and third class notary public’s offices situated in the district in which the court of first instance had been erected is dismantled, it can be closed by the Ministry of Justice upon the proposition of the Notaries Union of Turkey. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Classification of notary public’s offices</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Article 4 – The notary public’s offices are divided into four classes.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first, second and third class notary public’s offices are classified by the Ministry of Justice who takes the opinion of the Notaries Union of Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> This classification is based upon the population of the field of jurisdiction, the business overload and the notary public’s income. Generally, the notary public’s offices related to the same court are considered in the same class.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> In every four year, the Ministry of Justice examines the notary public’s offices’ situation and announces its reclassification in the Official Journal. &nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The new notaries established during the four year mentioned in the above clause are classified without delay in accordance with the second clause and their estimated gross incomes and are announced in the Official Journal.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> The provision of the article 31 concerning the right to relegation to the fourth class notary is reserved. In so far, those who will be promoted to the third class notary public’s offices are determined and announced at the beginning of April of each year. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Until the new classification is announced, the practice is done according to the old classification.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> Notary public’s office’s class and the minimum service time</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> Article 4/a – (Added with article 1 of the Law 3588 dated 16/1/1989.)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> The notary publics are divided into three classes. The service of third class of those who’s gone into notary public by being appointed for the very first time as a third class notary public begin at its business start date.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p> &nbsp;The minimum service time of the first and/or third class notary public is four years.
